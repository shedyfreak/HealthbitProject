==================================================

Sprint 1
========

Documentation:
-------------

NEXT SPRINT: ADD MENU IN SITE WEBSITE NOT EVERYTHING IN VISION. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

Vision and Stakeholders

    A more detailed description (textual) of each stakeholder might be usefull.
    It is important to have a contact address.
    (-0.25)

User Stories

    Format of user stories does not conform with the slides.
    (-0.25)

    User stories must have a success and failure entry
    (-0.25)


Domain Model

		Description of concepts is missing.

		Description of associations and multiplicities are OK but a bit too short.

    Association Patient 1 --- 1 Device should be Patient 0,1 --- 0,1
		(-0.25)

    In Doctor & Admin concepts: attribute password and username are missing.
		as well as the unique identifier for Patient 
		(-0.25)

		Add {ordered} in contains association Measurement side.
		
Actors

    OK

    You should describe each actor with a paragraph

    (E-Mail Service is not necessary but not false)
    

Non functional requirements

    Some important non functional requirement are missing

        
          large number of patient
          ** many doctor can use simultaneously the system **

          some of non functional requirements you mentionned are not relevant
          Manageability for example

Glossary

    Ok but too short, I am sure that other terms might be relevant.

Product Backlog

    No product backlog (see user stories) estimation is missing
		(-0.25)

Object Diagram

It is not an Object Diagram but a Class diagram

  Information not required but very usefull, we will see that we need such diagram for the implementation.
	Design Class Diagram (DCD).
	(+0.25) bonus.


Implementation:
--------------

Patient:

Constructor: Some parameter of the constructor are not necessary, in particular Device, ObservationPeriod because such informations are not known during the creation of a Patient.

ObservationPeriod: Association with Measure is missing

Measurement: requires some getters

Doctor: getPassword does not make sense

Device: OK

Javadoc: several class do not have any documentation
  (-0.5)

Tests:

Test coverage:  Not satisfactory tests

  inconsistance in import Assertions
  useless import Device
